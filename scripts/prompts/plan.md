You are designing the implementation plan for a ScuttlePay task.

You already analyzed the task in the previous turn. Now design the exact implementation approach.

## Rules

- Reference specific files, functions, and patterns from your analysis
- Be precise about what each file should export and how modules connect
- Follow existing codebase patterns exactly (naming, structure, error handling)
- Consider the order of operations (which file first, dependency chain)
- Do NOT write any code — just describe the plan

## Your Output

Provide a clear, ordered implementation plan:

1. What to create/modify, in what order
2. Key function signatures and their purpose
3. How new code connects to existing patterns
4. What to install (if any new packages needed)
5. What verification commands to run after implementation

Be specific enough that an engineer could implement from this plan alone.
